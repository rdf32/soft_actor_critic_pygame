    "highlight that started with random states keeping eval state the train state the same, then wasnt converging so decided to start with simplest case, one state -> get agent to overfit to it to determine if it is even possible -> started CNN approach -> wanted to reduce the dimensionality of the state space so that we could use a dnn model -> explain mask and then chip aggregates to create single vector -> showcase CNN works and could be trained better with more tuning and training but wanted to speed things up -> showcase overfitting of this problem but could be made to generalize -> analyze the results get some stats on how often the algorithms score a certain score and how they perform on other states -> compare CNN and DNN highlight it is because training was made easier by reduced dimensionality -> real world might not be as clean, would need to use UNET or something to encode the state space which isn't as accurate as known masking -> finally showcase the agent playing"
